Hi, this is the personal site of Derek Sun, and primarily serves as a portfolio site on cool things I have done. 
## SAFAR (Boral)

Over the course of 2019 I was involved in the UNSW Maker's Games a rapid ideation and prototyping competition. Our team was partnered with Boral and assisted them with developing a VR tool to assist in safe operation of electrical equipment. We developed a mobile application for Android, as well as a prototype Hololens version. In addition we used Tensorflow for image recognition, as well as Firebase and Python for our back-end. Our team won the $20000 Grand Prize, and continued working on the project until early 2020.

## Various video games cheats

In my spare time I enjoy working with friends making bots and cheats for various simple (Facebook Soccer, Basketball and Word Blitz) and some not so simple games (Valorant). Generally this involves some mix of computer vision, reinforcement learning and automation. As we generally aim for our bots/cheats to function on older hardware there is an non-trivial amount of optimization required. 
See video below of our Word Blitz bot (which as far as I am aware is the best openly available one):

## Kuse

Student data science I was a founding employee of. From 2019 to late 2020 assisted various SMEs with data science and database management, primarily using SQL and Python. We recently created a new [website][Kuse], and are in the process of expanding the team again.

## Other projects
Simple list of projects that either didn't make the cut or are still WIP:
 - Raytracer written in Julia (following RT1W)
 - Working through Project Euler (currently at problem ~75)
 - E-sports betting bot (relatively early stages, finished scraping data)
 - Serving as an advisor to student start-up
