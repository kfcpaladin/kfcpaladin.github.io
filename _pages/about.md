I'm currently a penultimate year student studying Pure Maths/ Statistics at University of Sydney (though I did study Finance prior), with my main interests being number theory and probability.
\
I've spent the past two years working as a consultant assisting SMEs, primarily focused on Data Science and database/query tuning. In addition I have previously been a part of a student start-up based at UNSW, and have been programming casually for ~10 years. \
My main hobbies/interests are reading non-fiction, gaming and cycling (however I haven't cycled much over the past year due to the pandemic).
